# touhou-midi-collection
A collection of MIDIs of the TouHou OSTs and some related arrangements.

Project was originally hosted on [Gamebanana](https://gamebanana.com/projects/35179), but I ~~stole~~ reuploaded the MIDIs on here for easier access.

## Repo Contents
In the root directory, every MIDI files are separated into sections to make it easier for a song to search.

There will be multiple MIDIs for the same track. It may vary in the sounds used or notations.

### What does each Folder Contain?
If you are having trouble with finding the game for which you want to download the MIDI, here is a quick guide that will tell what each era means:
  1. **1 - Shooter Games** - Official TouHou series
  2. **2 - Spin-Offs** - Minor releases of TouHou that does not include the main plot
  3. **3 - Fighting Games** - TouHou Fighting games
  4. **4 - Music CDs** - ZUN over time, has released some music discs,these CDs have arrangements as well as exclusive music
  5. **5 - Other- Misc** - Others MIDIs that doesn\'t really fit in the other categories
  6. **6 - Arranges** - Famous Arrangements of TouHou songs
  7. **7 - Fan and Related Games** - Games made by fans, many of them, without the participation of ZUN, the related games ZUN could be involved in some way

## So, what is MIDI?
MIDI means "Musical Instrument Digital Interface" and its an electronic musical instrument industry specification that enables a wide variety of digital musical instruments, computers and other related devices to connect and communicate with one another. It is a set of standard commands that allows electronic musical instruments, performance controllers, computers and related devices to communicate. You can say its like an electronic score.

Very difficult to understand? Imagine this, the roll of paper that gets into a pianola, but electronic, now instead of piano you can use several different instruments, And all that added to a low spec and easily modifiable. That would be a summary of MIDI.

## How to use it?
You can play them with any MIDI player/music player that supports playing MIDI files. You should use appropriate SoundFont pack for them to sound correctly.

Or, you can edit them or use them in any DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) that supports MIDI import (well every DAW supports MIDI Imports, I suppose).

If you want to go deeper into stuff like this and want the MIDIs to sound close to the original, you need to know the following info:
  - For MIDIs in TouHou 1 till 5, ZUN used Roland Edirol SC-88 Pro (1996). But since SC-88 Pro is out of production, you might consider using [Edirol Sound Canvas VA](https://www.roland.com/us/products/rc_sound_canvas_va/) VST. It includes soundbanks from SC-55, SC-88, SC-8820 and SC-88 Pro. \
  If available, you can buy it second-handed from sites like Ebay and other sites that sells stuff like these. \
  You can also use SoundFonts for SC-88 Pro.
  - For MIDIs in TouHou 6 till latest ones, ZUN used [Ronald Edirol SD-90](https://www.roland.com/global/products/sd-90/) (2001) among with several VSTs. SD-90 also have been discontinued since then. There is no VST for it, so you may need to rely on alternatives like THfont (this one is not generally recommended). If available, you can buy this one second-handed too. \
  Though you may find similar sounds from it in other SoundCanvas VSTs, for example, the Romantic TP preset from SD-90 (also popularly known as ZUNpet) is available on Roland SRX World VST as GypsyTrumpet in bank PR-A.

## Usage Policy
Rules similar to Creative Commons apply for most of the part. You can use the MIDIs and modify it, but you must credit the original creator, which is marked with brackets in the MIDI collection. \
**Except,** you **CANNOT** use MIDIs made by ZUN in fangames due to ZUN's new policies.
