# touhou-midi-collection
A collection of MIDIs of the TouHou OSTs and some other arrangemrnts.

Originally was hosted on [Gamebanana](https://gamebanana.com/projects/35179), but I ~~stole~~ downloaded ~~all~~ (I'll upload all of them soon) the MIDIs and reuploaded on here for the easier access.

## Repo Contents
In the root directory, every MIDI files are separated into "TouHou Eras" to make it easier for a song to search.

Under each folder, there will be more folders with the name of each game (except its a non-OST track). Each of them contains the MIDI files of the game. There will be multiple MIDIs for the same track. It may vary in the sounds used or notations.

### What does each Era mean?
If you are having trouble with finding the game for which you want to download the MIDI, here is a quick guide that will tell what each era means:
  1. Retro Era - from touhou 1 to touhou 5
  2. Classic Era - from touhou 6 to touhou 9 (2002 - 2005)
  3. Modern Era 1 - from touhou 10 to touhou 12 (2007 - 2010)
  4. Modern Era 2 - from touhou 13 onwards (2010 - Present)

## How to download?
If you want to download your desired MIDI file,

In case it goes to a page of text instead of downloading the file,

## So, what is MIDI?
MIDI means "Musical Instrument Digital Interface" and its an electronic musical instrument industry specification that enables a wide variety of digital musical instruments, computers and other related devices to connect and communicate with one another. It is a set of standard commands that allows electronic musical instruments, performance controllers, computers and related devices to communicate. You can say its like an electronic score.
Very difficult to understand? Imagine this, the roll of paper that gets into a pianola, but electronic, now instead of piano you can use several different instruments, And all that added to a low spec and easily modifiable. That would be a summary of MIDI.

## How to use it?
You can play them with any MIDI player/music player that supports playing MIDI files. You should appropriate SoundFont pack for them to sound correctly.

Or, you can edit them or use them in any DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) that supports MIDI import (well every DAW supports MIDI Imports, I suppose).
