# touhou-midi-collection
A collection of MIDIs of the TouHou OSTs and some other arrangemrnts.

Originally was hosted on [Gamebanana](https://gamebanana.com/projects/35179), but I download all the MIDIs and reuploaded on here for the easier access.

## Repo Contents
In the root directory, every MIDI files are separated into "TouHou Eras" to make it easier for a song to search.

### What does each Era mean?
If you are having trouble with finding the game for which you want to download the MIDI, here is a quick guide that will tell what each era means:
1. Retro Era - from touhou 1 to touhou 5
2. Classic Era - from touhou 6 to touhou 9 (2002 - 2005)
3. Modern Era 1 - from touhou 10 to touhou 12 (2007 - 2010)
4. Modern Era 2 - from touhou 13 onwards (2010 - Present)

## So, what is MIDI?
MIDI means "Musical Instrument Digital Interface" and its an electronic musical instrument industry specification that enables a wide variety of digital musical instruments, computers and other related devices to connect and communicate with one another. It is a set of standard commands that allows electronic musical instruments, performance controllers, computers and related devices to communicate. You can say its like an electronic score.
Very difficult to understand? Imagine this, the roll of paper that gets into a pianola, but electronic, now instead of piano you can use several different instruments, And all that added to a low spec and easily modifiable. That would be a summary of MIDI
